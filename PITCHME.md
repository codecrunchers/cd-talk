Sane Defaults to build on

Note: 
- last retro outcomes all symptoms of process
- reset, sane defaults and improve
- set a KPI

Note: 
- I have been employed in IT for 23 years, in networking , lecturing, bailed on phd ,contract teacher, contracting roles, self employed disasters &wins, contractor, finance/
trading houses ,  Engineering Delivery manger, architect, senior eng, principal - lot's of labels and software failures.

## CD

![](assets/img/train.jpg)

Note: 
- My last role was to bring a CD process to development team who weren't 'delviering'.
- I built and steered a team who had a really excellent Dev to Prod code release path.  I'd say, the team only had to DevOps/Documentation was less than 5%.  It was built with a developer mind set, on top of what I learned in PP about 6 years ago. You could release on Black Friday on your mobile whle having a beer.  We had per build, emepheral, DSL style environments spun up and wiped down for each stage of the pipeline.
- The business failed, really fast.
- At the team level,  I see CD as anagolous to the, Release IT,  bulkheading and backpressure patterns which separate areas of function , avoiding total lockout.

## Failing at CD

![](assets/img/crash.jpg)

Note: 
- I believe, unless the process reduces up from leaf nodes, and is strategically harnessed to enable a business's revenue channels - it probably does more damage overall than good - it provides a false sense of best practices. 

- Underestimating the ask on Platform/Ops
- Thinking CI is CD, CI s a capability within a CD Org.
- Not understanding it is a journey.

## The Ask of Our Team

![](assets/img/ask.jpg)

Note: 
- Our ask,  abstractly,  is to drive business success by applying a process that enables continuous d* of business value.  Concretely, we need to build a very simple base that allows us to elegantly bolt on features as the business ask.
- This is our job as a team.  How we manage that is largely up to us.
- Largely we have delivered on the business ask, or what the current stage in our CD capacbility undertsands to be value;  we know debt is cumulative. 
- The remaining tasks for the next 6 weeks are in place, we are going to stay on top of driving down cycle time.

## Process

![](assets/img/train.jpg)

Note: 
- Against the odds you deliverd on the core ask today.  I think this week illustrated that  attention to process brings trade-offs.  The bad is brought becuase we are only using aspects of CD, and it's an all in thing.
- We are now, I think , a loose version of Kanbaan.  We ae going to make this the contract between our engineering team and the business. 
- I will be available as needed, but will not interfere with execution of your work.  I'm happy to only row in when RFC comes about - or pitch in every day.

## Why

![](assets/img/why.jpg)

Note: 
- pressure won't go away,  but we can demonstrate our professionalism as a team by working on our process.
- Software businesses allow a lot of time for process improvement, realising it is an long term investment, it is an ask of our roles.

## Measuring

![](assets/img/measure.jpg)

Note: 
 - tfs provides this measurement tool, I want us to use it,  I will work with you to add a goal/key result during 1-1s 
- we are measuring to improve, we are scientists. It is not to 'clock in' in any way.


---

## Ownership

The Process and flexibility around it is a tool we have,to manage instability in a software development environment

![](assets/img/ownership.jpg)

Note: 
- As a team you own, and can adapt that  process to manage our delivery
- As a team you also own the time allowed and the process that emerges
- As a team you will raise blockers, I will work with Product to try and solve, we won't  be be Priority in every case.

## My Asks of you as a team

![](assets/img/teamask.png)

Note: 

- Use the process as your protocol - (You will be able to use tfs to see what is planned for at least 6 weeks - if you can't raise a blocker)
- own all your tasks (yours and those related to your sphere of ownership )
- own at least 3 sprints ahead..
- own our software, make it a platform
- Stay on top of broader platform and Feature requests via planning & process driven sessions
- To a large extent self-manage and own deliverables, 
- Build a low maintenance base platform -  we can expand with the business needs
- Knowing the startup we joined is not a perfect place, Innovate and adapt, we will not be given clear requirements, resources will be stretched.
- Continue to use retros to improve process, the cycle time graph *is* the target of the retro, nothing
- Raise blockers & and solutions :wink: to me early
- Decide on what is happening with WhietBoard, duplicating is time consuming, no point if not maintained.
- Find your want to deliver 'thing' for Process/Improvement and create a 'Betterworks Goal for it'

Retro Chat

---

## Intro
I want to address the last retro, when I dig into it's outcomes and some of previous ones I think a core underlying issue is our application of _process_ as a business and a team.  

Mainly, I want to reset our Process to a sane default, talk about improvement and process ownership.  We will improve this base; antything detailed below, via a LEAN process.

### BG 

First, very brief Bio, to give context of the direction I want us to move in as a team.

I have been employed in IT for 23 years, in networking , lecturing, bailed on phd ,contract teacher, contracting roles, self employed disasters &wins, contractor, finance/
trading houses ,  Engineering Delivery manger, architect, senior eng, principal - lot's of labels and software failures.

### CD

My last role was to bring a CD process to development team who weren't 'delviering'.

I built and steered a team who had a really excellent Dev to Prod code release path.  I'd say, the team only had to DevOps/Documentation was less than 5%.  It was built with a developer mind set, on top of what I learned in PP about 6 years ago. You could release on Black Friday on your mobile whle having a beer.  We had per build, emepheral, DSL style environments spun up and wiped down for each stage of the pipeline.

The business failed, really fast.

At the team level,  I see CD as anagolous to the, Release IT,  bulkheading and backpressure patterns which separate areas of function , avoiding total lockout. 

### Failing at CD

I believe, unless the process reduces up from leaf nodes, and is strategically harnessed to enable a business's revenue channels - it probably does more damage overall than good - it provides a false sense of best practices. 

### Ask

Our ask,  abstractly,  is to drive business success by applying a process that enables continuous d* of business value.  Concretely, we need to build a very simple base that allows us to elegantly bolt on features as the business ask.

This is our job as a team.  How we manage that is largely up to us.

Largely we have delivered on the business ask, or what the current stage in our CD capacbility undertsands to be value;  we know debt is cumulative. 

The remaining tasks for the next 6 weeks are in place, we are going to stay on top of driving down cycle time.

### Process
Against the odds you deliverd on the core ask today.  I think this week illustrated that  attention to process brings trade-offs.  The bad is brought becuase we are only using aspects of CD, and it's an all in thing.

We are now, I think , a loose version of Kanbaan.  We ae going to make this the contract between our engineering team and the business. 

I will be available as needed, but will not interfere with execution of your work.  I'm happy to only row in when RFC comes about - or pitch in every day.  

### Why

- pressure won't go away,  but we can demonstrate our professionalism as a team by working on our process.
- Software businesses allow a lot of time for process improvement, realising it is an long term investment, it is an ask of our roles. 

### Measuring
- tfs provides this measurement tool, I want us to use it,  I will work with you to add a goal/key result during 1-1s 
- we are measuring to improve, we are scientists. It is not to 'clock in' in any way.

### Ownership
The Process and flexibility around it is a tool we have,to manage instability in a software development environment
- As a team you own, and can adapt that  process to manage our delivery
- As a team you also own the time allowed and the process that emerges
- As a team you will raise blockers, I will work with Product to try and solve, we won't  be be Priority in every case. 

### My Asks to You
- Use the process as your protocol - (You will be able to use tfs to see what is planned for at least 6 weeks - if you can't raise a blocker)
- own all your tasks (yours and those related to your sphere of ownership )
- own at least 3 sprints ahead..
- own our software, make it a platform
- Stay on top of broader platform and Feature requests via planning & process driven sessions
- To a large extent self-manage and own deliverables, 
- Build a low maintenance base platform -  we can expand with the business needs
- Knowing the startup we joined is not a perfect place, Innovate and adapt, we will not be given clear requirements, resources will be stretched.
- Continue to use retros to improve process, the cycle time graph *is* the target of the retro, nothing
- Raise blockers & and solutions :wink: to me early
- Find your want to deliver 'thing' and create a 'Betterworks Goal for it'
